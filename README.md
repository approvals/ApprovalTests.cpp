## What are Approval Tests?

Also known as **Golden Master Tests** or **Snapshot Testing**, Approval Tests are an alternative to asserts. If you are unfamiliar with them, we have an [overview](/doc/Overview.md#top) and a [tutorial](/doc/Tutorial.md#top).

They are great for testing objects with lots of fields, or lists of objects.

## Requirements

* C++11 (or above) compiler
* Mac/Linux/Windows
* One of:  [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest), [Catch1](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/Catch1.x), [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2), [doctest](https://github.com/onqtam/doctest)  

## Getting Started

* Download [The Approval.cpp Starter Project](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Cpp.StarterProject)
* Read the [Getting Started](/doc/GettingStarted.md#top) page
* [Set up your main file.](/doc/GettingStarted.md#main-file)
* Read the [**User Guide**](/doc/README.md#top).
* Watch the [Videos](/doc/Videos.md#top)

## ToString (ostream insertion)
Often, you will need to create functions to allow objects to print their state. This is commonly done with an ostream `<< operator`.
You can find examples here: [To String](/doc/ToString.md#top)
