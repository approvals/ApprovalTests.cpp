## Combination Testing

Sometimes referred to as Combinatorial testing.

## Continuous Integration

## Convention over Configuration  

[Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)

Instead of asking the user to specify everything, we make assumptions based on common patterns, so code usually just works "out of the box". This tends to dramatically reduce the amount of clutter, makes things easier, and reduces the amount of surprises.

## Custom Asserts

## Diff Tool

## Disposable Objects

Objects that implement the [RAII](#raii-resource-acquisition-is-initialization) pattern.

See [Disposable Objects](/doc/DisposableObjects.md#top).

## RAII (Resource acquisition is initialization)

This is a pattern where your object constructor opens a resource, such as memory, and your object destructor closes the resource.

This is also known as "Scope based resource management".
