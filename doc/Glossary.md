## Approving Results

## Approved File

## Chain of responsibility (pattern)

## Code Coverage

## Combination Testing

Sometimes referred to as Combinatorial testing.

See [Testing Combinations](/doc/TestingCombinations.md#top).

## Comparator

See [Custom Comparators](/doc/CustomComparators.md#top).

## Continuous Integration

## Convention over Configuration  

[Wikipedia Entry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)

Instead of asking the user to specify everything, we make assumptions based on common patterns, so code usually just works "out of the box". This tends to dramatically reduce the amount of clutter, makes things easier, and reduces the amount of surprises.

## Custom Asserts

## Diff Tool

## Edge Case

## Happy Path

## Kata

## Koans

## Mutation Testing

## Namer

## Principle of Least Surprise

## Received File

## Reporter

See [Reporters](/doc/Reporters.md#top).

See [Using sub-directories for approved files](/doc/Configuration.md#using-sub-directories-for-approved-files)

See [Features](/doc/Features.md#top) - whose sections need to be moved around

## Scrubber

[ApprovalTests.Net](https://github.com/approvals/ApprovalTests.Net/tree/master/ApprovalTests/Scrubber)

## Stringification

See [ToString](/doc/ToString.md#top).

## Test Framework

## test && commit || revert (TCR)

## Writer

## Yak Shaving

## Sayings

* Test until bored
